                                    <h3>Pitfalls and Opportunities of Single-page Applications</h3>
                                    <p>The thick client is back! Pushing entire applications down to the client has become a lot more popular in recent times, and is especially interesting for mobile devices. </p>
                                    <p>Building a really solid and polished single-page applications means that we need to replicate a lot of native browser behaviour, and when we don’t we’ll annoy or even scare away our users. This talk will cover both pitfalls and opportunities of single-page applications, with a focus on native behaviour that your app needs to provide in order to behave like an actual web site, while fixing a lot of the usability issues that web sites usually have. </p>
                                    <p>Topics covered include dealing with proper URLs without breaking back and forward buttons and using the (still somewhat new) HTML5 history.pushState API. We’ll look at existing (and still missing) frameworks that help implement these behaviours.</p>

                                    <h3>Building Large-scale Applications With jQuery</h3>
                                    <p>Developers creating JavaScript applications these days usually use a combination of MVC, modules, widgets and plugins for their architecture. They also use a DOM manipulation library like jQuery. </p>
                                    <p>Whilst this works great for apps that are built at a smaller-scale, what happens when your project really starts to grow? In this talk, Addy presents an effective set of design patterns for large-scale JavaScript (and jQuery) application architecture that have previously been used at both AOL and Yahoo amongst others. </p>
                                    <p>You'll learn how to keep your application logic truly decoupled, build modules that can exist on their own or be dropped into other projects and future-proof your code in case you need to switch to a different DOM library in the future.</p>

                                    <p>The enemy of maintainable code is extensive configuration and over-declaration – both of which tie your code to specific pages and sections in your application. Since so much instructional data is described by the HTML of your site, why should you need to redefine it all again in JavaScript? In this session, learn how to develop clean, responsible jQuery code that responds to its context instead of the traditional, define everything, top-down approach. This session will cover how event delegation, traversal methods and advanced selectors all work together to let you write more efficient and less wasteful code.</p>

                                    <p>Today’s browsers sport amazing capabilities, truly graduating from markup renderers to sophisticated app run-times. We're sure to see some amazing new web applications just over the horizon that take advantage of these new capabilities. </p>
                                    <p>At the same time, the mobile ecosystem is white hot and we’re seeing a range of start-ups pursue an "app-only" strategy. What relationship do mobile “apps” have with the web and how will these two communities co-exist into the future? Also, how do developers target all of these different platforms? Which should they embrace and which should they ignore?</p>

                                    <h3>Aloha Editor - jQuery based contenteditable</h3>
                                    <p>Aloha editor was created with the goal to revolutionize the online editing experience. Being the only true HTML5 contentEditable solution allows us to provide inline editing that put us far ahead the competition. The lack of an adopted specification for contentEditable in browsers and inconsistent implementations drive developers crazy. Aloha Editor wraps commandExec consistently across browsers and provides additional functionalities such as table editing, image handling, block handling.</p>

                                    <h3>Embracing and celebrating redundancy</h3>
                                    <p>JavaScript was always the language to make the web more interactive and fill the gaps that browsers had when it comes to interaction with the user. With jQuery we moved even further and concentrated on that task, replacing the unwieldy native DOM with a simpler way to spice up our web sites. With browsers moving ahead it is time though to reflect and see just how much code we write that actually is not needed any longer as browsers give us native controls in HTML5. In this talk Chris Heilmann of Mozilla will show just in how many ways modern browsers make it easy for us to offer a rich experience without having to create that on our own. We'll look at UI elements, multimedia capabilities, drawing, animation and how to tie into our user's browsing and web behaviour without forcing a certain path on them. We have amazing technology to play with, we should use it and look ahead instead of patching for the past.</p>

                    <p>jQuery UK is proudly presented by <a href="http://www.whiteoctober.co.uk">White October</a>, a digital agency based in Oxford.  We felt that it was about time that the UK hosted the World's leading jQuery visionaries for a conference dedicated to a technology that has become the centre-piece of current front-end web development.</p>
                    <h3>Relationship with the jQuery Project</h3>
                    <p class="info">White October is organising this conference with the permission of the <a href="http://jquery.org/">jQuery Project</a> and its fiscal sponsoring USA non-profit organisation, <a href="http://sfconservancy.org/">the Software Freedom Conservancy</a>. All revenue from the conference goes to White October, who has agreed to donate 5% of the gross revenue from this event to the Software Freedom Conservancy, earmarked for the jQuery Project. The Software Freedom Conservancy is a charitable 501(c)(3) not-for-profit corporation in New York, USA.</p>
